## How To Use It
 
Using Wavesfactory Cassette 1.0.2 is very easy and intuitive. You can simply load it on any track or bus and choose a preset from the drop-down menu, or tweak the parameters to your liking. The plugin has a mix knob that allows you to blend the dry and wet signals for parallel processing, as well as input and output VU meters to monitor the levels.
 
The main controls are located on the tape deck itself, where you can select the tape and deck type, adjust the tape speed, stability, degradation, bias, and level. You can also engage or disengage various elements of the effect, such as saturation, compression, noise, wow and flutter, crosstalk, and HF loss. These elements can be further customised in the Settings panel, which can be accessed by clicking on the cog icon at the top right corner of the plugin window.
 
In the Settings panel, you can fine-tune the frequency response, saturation curve, compression ratio and threshold, noise envelope and volume, wow and flutter rate and depth, crosstalk amount and frequency range, HF loss randomness and amount, and stereo unbalance amount and frequency range. You can also enable oversampling for better sound quality, and change the skin colour of the plugin.
